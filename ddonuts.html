   <p><b>Darwizzy Donuts: Week 1</b></p>

<p><b><em>A report by Advait Sharma.</em></b></p>

<li>A team of pure excellence, a team full of enthusiasm to the top this is Darwizzy Donuts: Daredevils of Darwizzy. 
Their sport, tchoukball, played with pure finesse it is as if goal-scoring courses through their veins. They made their debut at Upton Court Grammar School last week, coursing through all their games effortlessly. Here is the full story stay tuned, this is going to be the next big thing of sports.</li>

<li>Leave Manchester United, leave Liverpool, last week, fans were crowding around the UCGS MUGA to witness the spectacle of the Darwizzy Donuts. As they made their entry, their managers, Nash Kugarooban and Eeshan Panesar, came to talk to us.</li>

<li>Nash Kugarooban and Eshan Panesar gave us their thoughts on the match,
<em>Its gonna be a great one. I think, because of the sheer athleticism mixed within our team we are one hell of a competition for them.</em></li>

<li>Mr. Panesar said to us,
<em>Yeah, like what Nash said, we have immense trust within each other, and we are sure to win. Our strengths you will see today.‚Äù</em></li>

<li>Bold words. And they did live up to this statement. Their first game was against the orange team, and the odds couldnt have been higher. This was one team that was sure to give them one tough fight.</li>

<li>As the team pounced onto the pitch their eyes flamed like the embers in a tigers eye, their stance ready and confident. This move proved to be their masterstroke building fear deep within the hearts of the orange team.</li> 

<li>Despite the evident height disadvantage, Eeshan Panesar leapt onto the ball, just as the referee the highly experienced Mr. Ensby threw it into the air.</li>

<li>The ball took no time to find it in the hands of the player, who took the record for the most goals for the Donuts yet, Advait Sharma. He skilfully commandeered the players for the best passes, and eventually sent the ball in from more than halfway across the pitch to whizz into the net, much like a missile. In no time, they were up 6-1.</li>

<li>Upon the whistle for the half-time, we went to their players, Kiaan Maniar and Advait Sharma for their thoughts on the match.</li>

<li>Mr. Maniar said,
<em>We have great set-ups and passes. Our fluency with the ball is unparalleled to any team playing on court. If we continue this we may have the chance to be the best team here.</em></li>

<li>Mr. Sharma said,
<em>Our deceptions, our camaraderie and our overall aura on the pitch is our strongest point. Providing that we sustain this, we may have the leading edge over everyone here.</em></li>

</li>As the second half commenced, performance from the orange team looked surprisingly improved. Their passes, their shooting all was heavily targeted. In no time, the Donuts found their lead diminishing, reaching a scary 6-5.</li> 

<li>As the Daredevils of Darwizzy focused their razor-sharp eyes on the ball, within 10 seconds of the orange teams fifth goal, Advait Sharma scored his third goal.</li>

<li><em>It was an absolutely sensational feeling. The crowd, all fifty-thousand of them, cheering my name. But I knew I had more left in me than to take the pride.</em> Sharma told us.
Soon, the score went 11-7, with Advait scoring three more goals, and the skipper, Nash Kugarooban fixing his precision-driven eyes on the middle on the net, scoring in the last 4 seconds.</li>

<li>This was their week 1 will they do better next time? Or will it end in tragedy for the daring Darwizzy Donuts? 
Thank You. Keep Reading, Keep dreaming.</li>
